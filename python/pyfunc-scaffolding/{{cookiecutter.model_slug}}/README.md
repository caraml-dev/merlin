## CI setup

CI has been setup up with 2 stages, test and deploy. To make CI work, dev need to set variable `GITLAB_RUNNER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` in CI environment variables.
Dev can get value of `GITLAB_RUNNER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` by asking dsp to create it on #dsp-helpdesk or #merlin-users slack channels.
