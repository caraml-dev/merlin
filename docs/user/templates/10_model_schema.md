# Model Schema

Model schema is a specification of input and output of a model, such as what are the features columns, prediction columns and also ground truth columns. Following are the fields in model schema:

| Field | Type | Description | Mandatory |
|-------|------|-------------|-----------|
| `id` | int | Unique identifier for each model schema | Not mandatory, if ID is not specified it will create new model schema otherwise it will update the model schema with corresponding ID |
| `model_id`| int | Model ID that correlate with the schema | Not mandatory, if not specified the SDK will assign it with the model that user set |
| `spec` | InferenceSchema | Detail specification for model schema | True |

Detail specification is defined by using `InferenceSchema` class, following are the fields:
| Field | Type | Description | Mandatory |
|-------|------|-------------|-----------|
| `feature_types` | Dict[str, ValueType] | Mapping between feature name with the type of the feature | True |
| `model_prediction_output` | PredictionOutput | Prediction specification that differ between model types, e.g BinaryClassificationOutput, RegressionOutput, RankingOutput | True |
| `prediction_id_column` | str | The column name that contains prediction id value | True |
| `tag_columns` | Optional[List[str]] | List of column names that contains additional information about prediction, you can treat it as metadata | False |

From above we can see `model_prediction_output` field that has type `PredictionOutput`, this field is a specification of prediction that is generated by the model depending on it's model type. Currently we support 3 model types in the schema:
* Binary Classification
* Regression
* Ranking

Each model type has it's own model prediction output specification.

## Binary Classification
Model prediction output specification for Binary Classification type is `BinaryClassificationOutput` that has following fields:

| Field | Type | Description | Mandatory |
|-------|------|-------------|-----------|
| `prediction_score_column` | str | Column that contains prediction score value of a model. Prediction score must be between 0.0 and 1.0 | True |
| `actual_label_column` | str | Name of the column containing the actual class | False, because not all model has the ground truth |
| `positive_class_label` | str | Label for positive class | True |
| `negative_class_label` | str | Label for negative class | True |
| `score_threshold` | float | Score threshold for prediction to be considered as positive class | False, if not specified it will use 0.5 as default |

## Regression
Model prediction output specification for Regression type is `RegressionOutput` that has following fields:

| Field | Type | Description | Mandatory |
|-------|------|-------------|-----------|
| `prediction_score_column` | str | Column that contains prediction score value of a model | True |
| `actual_score_column` | str | Name of the column containing the actual score | False, because not all model has the ground truth |


## Ranking
Model prediction output specification for Ranking type is `RankingOutput` that has following fields:

| Field | Type | Description | Mandatory |
|-------|------|-------------|-----------|
| `rank_score_column` | str | Name of the column containing the ranking score of the prediction | True |
| `prediction_group_id_column` | str | Name of the column containing the prediction group id | True |
| `relevance_score_column` | str | Name of the column containing the relevance score of the prediction | True |

## Define model schema
From the specification above, users can create the schema for their model. Suppose that users have binary classification model, that has 4 features
* featureA that has float type
* featureB that has int type
* featureC that has string type
* featureD that has float type

With positive class `complete` and negative class `non_complete` and the threshold for positive class is 0.75. Actual label is stored under column `target`, `prediction_score` under column `score` `prediction_id` under column `prediction_id`. From that specification, users can define the model schema and put it alongside version creation. Below is the example snipped code

```python
from merlin.model_schema import ModelSchema
from merlin.observability.inference import InferenceSchema, ValueType, BinaryClassificationOutput
 model_schema = ModelSchema(spec=InferenceSchema(
        feature_types={
            "featureA": ValueType.FLOAT64,
            "featureB": ValueType.INT64,
            "featureC": ValueType.STRING,
            "featureD": ValueType.BOOLEAN
        },
        session_id_column="session_id",
        row_id_column="row_id",
        model_prediction_output=BinaryClassificationOutput(
            prediction_score_column="score",
            actual_label_column="target",
            positive_class_label="complete",
            negative_class_label="non_complete",
            score_threshold=0.75
        )
    ))
with merlin.new_model_version(model_schema=model_schema) as v:
    ....

```

The above snipped code will define model schema and attach it to certain model version, the reason is the schema for each version is possible to differ.
