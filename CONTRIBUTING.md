# Contributing

We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/caraml-dev/merlin/issues) to communicate development ideas. The simplest way to contribute to Merlin is to leave comments on our GitHub issues.

We follow a process of [lazy consensus](http://community.apache.org/committers/lazyConsensus.html). If you believe you know what the project needs then just start development. If you are unsure about which direction to take with development then please communicate your ideas through a GitHub issue before starting development.

Please [submit a PR](https://github.com/caraml-dev/merlin/pulls) to the master branch of the Merlin repository once you are ready to submit your contribution. Once submitted, GitHub Actions will run a range of tests to verify the submission, after which community members will help to review the pull request. Pull request to Merlin (including a submission from project maintainers) requires review and approval from maintainers.
