The version endpoint is specific to a certain model version and the url will change everytime a new version is deployed. Hence, version endpoint is not suitable to be shared publicly or being used for integration. \n",

The benefit of using model endpoint is that we can specify which version of the model being used (by redirecting traffic from one model version to another) without having our client to change the url."
