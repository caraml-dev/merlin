## Overview

Merlin is a platform for deploying and serving machine learning models. The project was born of the belief that model deployment should be:

* **Easy and self-serve**: Human should not become the bottleneck for deploying model into production.
* **Scalable**: The model deployed should be able to handle Gojek scale and beyond.
* **Fast**: The framework should be able to let user iterate quickly.
* **Cost efficient**: It should provide all benefit above in a cost efficient manner.

Merlin attempts to do so by:

* **Abstracting infrastructure**: Merlin uses familiar concept such as Project, Model, Version, and Endpoint as its core component and abstract away complexity of deploying and serving ML service from user.
* **Autoscaling**: Merlin is built on top Knative and KFServing to provide a production ready serverless solution.
